Kube-Combo is a Pod-based orchestration system that provides a wide variety of network element capabilities, providing rich functionality and good operability.

## Rich features

If you find that some advanced network features such as IPsec vpn GW, SSL vpn GW, Haproxy, Nginx etc. cannot be used directly in the K8S cluster, then Kube-Combo will be your best choice.
With the underlying capabilities provided by the K8S CNI, multiple POD payloads can be combined with a wide variety of mature applications to provide highly available and rich network element capabilities.

## Good operation and maintenance

Kube-Combo supports one-click installation, helping users quickly build production-ready network applications.
At the same time, the built-in rich monitoring indicators and Grafana panel can help users establish a sound monitoring system.
